# Tips

* When heating up your pan with butter , do not have the temperature so hot that the butter blackens. The butter should either just fade away or be a nice brown color.
* Do not overstuff your omelette, you should have enough filling to be in the omelette but not so much that when you go to flip in on its side everything spills out.
* The perfect time to flip the omlette is when you see the sides of your eggs start to stiffen up and not become runny anymore which shouldn't be that long after you start cooking.
